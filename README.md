# My-Pokedex

Pseudocode:
create a Div pokeBall to hold the details from the pokeapi
create a h3 tag to hold the name of the pokemon, append to Div
create a p tag to hold the index number of the pokemon, append to Div

main api did not have pictures i wanted to use, so called on another api in my img tag.

originally the plan was to put these in a container and create a carousel for the user to cycle through the pokedex, due to issues with my code I hit the api too many times and it caused them to start to block certain images. (last night 16 random images would not load) 

in its place i made the dex into a search bar and modal(not the prettiest)
as of this morning I have full access to the api for pictures 

next time I will do better research on the api i selected and I will try not to hit one 10000 times in an hour.
